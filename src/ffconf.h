#define	_FS_TINY		0	/* 0:Normal or 1:Tiny */
/* When _FS_TINY is set to 1, FatFs uses the sector buffer in the file system
/  object instead of the sector buffer in the individual file object for file
/  data transfer. This reduces memory consumption 512 bytes each file object. */


#define _FS_READONLY	0	/* 0:Read/Write or 1:Read only */
/* Setting _FS_READONLY to 1 defines read only configuration. This removes
/  writing functions, f_write, f_sync, f_unlink, f_mkdir, f_chmod, f_rename,
/  f_truncate and useless f_getfree. */


#define _FS_MINIMIZE	0	/* 0 to 3 */
/* The _FS_MINIMIZE option defines minimization level to remove some functions.
/
/   0: Full function.
/   1: f_stat, f_getfree, f_unlink, f_mkdir, f_chmod, f_truncate and f_rename
/      are removed.
/   2: f_opendir and f_readdir are removed in addition to 1.

/   1: Word access. Do not choose this unless following condition is met.
/
/  When the byte order on the memory is big-endian or address miss-aligned word
/  access results incorrect behavior, the _WORD_ACCESS must be set to 0.
/  If it is not the case, the value can also be set to 1 to improve the
